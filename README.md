ideas
---

* make a table generator with a checklist, should i include microwave, lobster, etc. Should I include pictures, quotes, audio controls.
* keyboard shortcuts
* ui should be flexible and take up the height and width of the page
* if the square root of the total number of sounds is a whole number then use that for the number of rows and columns. If not then round up and use that.
* make a remote control for someone else to use it
* make it so a twitch audience could use it if they get the permission to
